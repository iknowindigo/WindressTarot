        "CARD": "ace",
        "SUIT": "Pentacles",
        "THOUGHTS": "Aces indicate new beginnings. Traditionally, the Ace of Pentacles often focuses on an earthly theme, such as new possessions, a new job, the sudden gain or loss of money and worldly goods. As spiritual travelers, however, this card can mean the inception of our real spiritual journey, beginning with our breaking away from dependency on the earth and earthly life. We will begin to break out of our self, to emerge from the physical cocoon in which we now live. The Ace of Pentacles seals our acknowledgement that the physical realm is not the entirety of existence. There is more.",
        "KEY": "KEY: New beginnings of a spiritual journey, venture or study",
        "COMMENT": "The Ace of Pentacles has inspired many varied designs. It has also been named the ace of Coins, Discs, and Pentagrams. Here we see a green pentacle, inscribed within a white circle, resting in a spiraling wheel of palm fronds. The fronds symbolize earthly cycles being raised into a natural symmetry, suggesting an upward spiral by the presence of the pentacle in the center. It feels to us as if the pentacle itself is bursting forth through the center of earth’s bounty, revealing more than we had seen before. Remember the drawing of a man inscribed in the shape of a pentacle by Leonardo da Vinci."

        "SUIT": "Pentacles",
        "THOUGHTS": "As life moves along its path, destiny brings its many changes. The dancer in this card balances the two pentacles of duality with seeming ease as he moves through the steps of a dance by the sea. New situations require new angles of vision, new attitudes. Successful growth requires constant adaptation. We must constantly be prepared to juggle the old with the new. Life is a school, presenting a continual cycle of our karmic and dharmic ups and downs teaching us to become flexible in our attitudes. The leaps and turns, the pirouettes and spins the dancer makes, reflect these ups and downs of circumstance and the way he balances the self within change. We imagine ourselves as this figure; we are flooded with the beauty and freedom of the image. We feel the warm sand under our bare feet as we move through golden space and dance through time.",
        "KEY": "KEY: Harmony in the midst of change; juggling negative and positive influences that coexist in the mind",
        "COMMENT": "The Two of Pentacles is a warm card, rich in color, dreamlike in expression. The dancer’s tunic, adorned with butterflies, symbolizes his natural inclination to turn to the light, to dance in joy. The emblem of infinity rests upon his heart. The ocean symbolizes universal understanding and super consciousness as he dances to the rhythm of the crashing waves. The sky is a brilliant golden yellow, reflecting the dancer’s aura of high intelligence and creative ability."

        "SUIT": "Pentacles",
        "THOUGHTS": "C. S. Lewis writes, 'The reward for doing a good job is the opportunity to do a more difficult one.' We are all students in God’s Academy. As we gain skills to love and remain joyful through adversity, we are given harder lessons, and we work harder to understand and absorb those lessons. When seen in a spiritual Seeker’s reading, this card frequently means that an Initiation on the Path by a Spiritual Teacher may be forthcoming. In some sense Initiation is the greatest gift, or reward a soul can receive, yet it is the most difficult as well. To attain mastery in any craft or venture, we must work hard and pay careful attention to our teacher. Especially as students of mysticism, we are committing our hearts, minds, and soul to our chosen Path to God. If ever in our life, now it is essential to have found a teacher worthy of our trust, and pay close attention to them. We also learn, as a student on the Path, that everyone we meet, every soul, every creature shares in this teaching and learning experience. Love for God brings us closer and closer to these understandings—understandings which, through grace, arise within us and lead to Merging and Unity.",
        "KEY": "KEY: Mastery of knowledge; initiation or guidance by a spiritual teacher",
        "COMMENT": "In this card we see a female craftsman demonstrating the art of the architecture of an archway—a 'doorway' to two students. The archway is open, revealing an etheric pathway beyond it—as if the architecture and the architectural design were the gateway to a higher, more beautiful state. The students are enraptured, and seem to understand the special nature of the craftsmanship. The teacher is dressed in orange, the color of joy—depicting not only the joy of teaching but the joy of being a student and a participant. Never does a master craftsman stop learning from his or her students. There is no real separation in the process of learning between the Master and the disciple, for both are one."

        "SUIT": "Pentacles",
        "THOUGHTS": "Sometimes we hold on to our desires and goals after they have outlived their usefulness. This is guaranteed to lead to stagnation and frustration, because the painful accompaniments will hold on too, and we will not be able to move forward in a new direction. It is said that monkeys can be trapped by placing a piece of fruit in a jar. They reach into the jar and grasp the fruit, but then can’t get their fists out of the jar. In order to escape, all they would need to do would be to let go of the fruit, to release their grip. But they do not understand their own entrapment. When the Four of Pentacles shows up in a reading, it is time to reflect on our personal beliefs. This card almost always points to our need to validate our existence by holding on to life as we know it. No matter what the cost, no matter what the pain, the need for personal validation itself can become a dependency. Obsessively holding on to what we have can result in negative outcomes. On the other hand, we may discover that we also have the ability to hold on to essentially positive aspects of our lives under pressure.",
        "KEY": "KEY: Holding on to wealth or power; unable to let go of a relationship or personal circumstance",
        "COMMENT": "In this card, we see a young, dark-haired man sitting rigidly upon a velvet draped stool as he tightly grips a golden pentacle in his lap. His feet hold down two more pentacles. He wears an elaborate gold medallion, and a fourth pentacle is attached to a gold crown on his head. The outline of a city behind him suggests his prowess and possible rule of that city and the surrounding countryside. His expression is serious, somewhat strained, and he appears to be almost stressed with the effort of maintaining his grasp on the pentacles."

Note their faces—gray tones etched with lines of hopelessness and apathy, drawn from years of wandering lost and believing in the illusions of worldly life. Their dull, ragged clothes further demonstrate resignation to a fate condemned by pain and suffering. Five is a number signifying raw energy, usually pulling toward discord and negativity. Pentacles symbolize earthly knowledge and total belief in maya, illusion. This card signifies separation and exclusion caused by the mind’s inability to find inner harmony while in the world. When we are in the worst of poverty and conditions, we may reach out to one another for love and support. Frequently we experience only rejection and self-pity, but the beggar in this card hopes for more as she reaches out to the crippled passerby. Longing may also be an interpretation when the Five of Pentacles is dealt in a reading, and personal rejection then transforms into longing for God. It denotes an effort toward reaching for the Light while immersed in darkness.",
        "KEY": "KEY: Trapped in our karmas and unable to turn to the Light",
        "COMMENT": "We see a dark and oppressive card, except for the dim gray light from the soaring towers of a dark unknown temple in the background. In the foreground, with her back to the temple, sits a raggedly dressed woman on a cracked sidewalk. She reaches out her hand to a cripple walking past. She holds a begging bowl in her outstretched hand. The crippled man is hooded, his eyes are cast upon the sidewalk before him, and he does not even seem to notice her."

Whenever we stop and consider our fate, we have much to be thankful for. When things are good, remember that all things are gifts from God. Our joy and trust from within is working for love towards all others as we grow closer to God. As in this card, we may be the recipient or we may be the giver, but in either case, giving and receiving are one and the same. Indeed, receiving is giving to the giver; from a higher perspective, the giver and receiver are one. Even in the worst of times, remember that pain is a gift which can open our hearts to the shower of God’s love. When we feel disappointed with life, remember that our cup is not half empty, but half full. And when we see that all our experience is the Grace of God in action, we find that the cup of life has been overflowing all along.",
        "KEY": "KEY: Spiritual gifts; extending love and kindness to others",
        "COMMENT": "Maharaj Charan Singh (Maharaj Ji) has said, 'When we are in love with God, when we are truly in love with our Lord within us, then we do not have to try to be kind and giving to others. We cannot help ourselves. We radiate peace, we radiate love, and we automatically are helping everyone and everything we touch.' In this card we see a figure of a beneficent looking man giving alms to the poor. He is dressed in beautiful deep blue robes, suggesting great wealth, royalty. He stands next to a city archway; his face is bathed in peace. As we look upon this card, we definitely feel that the joy of those who are receiving has little to do with the coins they are receiving, but the kindness of the giver. He, in turn, seems blissful in his act of giving. He holds golden scales in his left hand, signifying fairness and balance."

Our best solution is to give all to God and to allow God’s will to determine the fruits of our efforts. By committing the fruits of all our work to God we move through life free from confusion and we are enabled to use the fruits of our efforts.",

At every stage, we look with humility on our progress, and the challenges yet to come. Even though we cannot see the end of our journey, we know we must work at each task presented to us as if it were for God, for so, indeed, it is. Each new day, each new moment, is a workshop in which we practice our devotion to God. Gradually we realize that our experience and inner growth automatically give us the ability to lovingly touch others with hope, faith, and strength. This card may also indicate that we are to be commissioned to act more directly in carrying out God’s plan.",

This card also represents perception without bias, another indication of clear thinking. Notice again that this card is represented by a woman alone. Fulfilling personal goals is part of the reason we are born in a separated human form. As we move through our destiny, whatever it may be, we take a step closer to our greater fulfillment in Spirit. Remember that all effort and all success are God’s grace. 'Thy Will, not mine, Oh Lord!'",

This symbolism reflects the growing awareness of the collective consciousness towards all life forms—including animal intelligence. It signifies the energy of the Nine of Pentacles, as it not only denotes a new collective understanding, but the evolution of that understanding by the individual."

        "CARD": "ten",
        "SUIT": "Pentacles",
        "THOUGHTS": "When we come into this world we discover that we must creatively build and learn in order to grow. That positive goal presses us on to acquire a prestigious family, an excellent community standing, the respect of many, and so on. Gradually we have achieved these objectives in our life, only to realize that we have become trapped by these very accomplishments and achievements. Maharaj Ji has also said, 'We may pray ten years to marry, but once we are married, we may pray for the next ten years to be released from the same marriage!' Ten generally means 'one too many,' an overflowing. In Pentacles, ten may mean that we need to untangle from our family—or any of our personal worldly circumstances—even our worldly accomplishments. We may feel tired, disgruntled, or even frustrated with our current life and our attachments in life. As we work to excel, it is natural to build towards accomplishments, to increase our family and our material goods, as well as our education. But gradually we find ourselves surrounded by family, friends, relationships, and choked by our accomplishments and acquisitions. These very goals start revealing themselves as burdensome and obstacles to our real goal—spiritual growth and enlightenment. From this perspective, the Ten of Pentacles represents saturation—not just with our family, but with our life’s accomplishments in general. The accompanying responsibilities have finally become too much for too long. Even maintaining what we have is almost boring. The joy, enthusiasm, and freedom we started with seem dull and uninteresting. A strange unease pervades us. What happened to the freedom and joy, the enthusiasm? The solution lies within us, in our devotion to meditation. We can be surrounded by all the circumstances, conditions and achievements we have made in our worldly life, but our longing for God is a gift which will gradually free us from our identification with those very accomplishments. Maharaj Ji has said, 'No matter what our status on earth, what we have achieved, how privileged or richly we live, how large and close-knit our family, we are prisoners to these very accomplishments. We may have exchanged iron chains for golden ones, but we are still bound here. Only through meditation do we rise above this worldly prison.'",

A cat wanders comfortably near her feet. Behind her is a sunlit window. An older gentleman, her grandfather, sits outside the door. The deep red of his robes indicates that he may be feeling more energy than the years of a successful family tradition might imply."

All learning is easier when it comes through fresh, youthful curiosity. The studies suggested by this card are not necessarily found in books. We must remember that our very life is a school, and God is our teacher. Everyone is capable of seeing life through these youthful eyes, no matter what their age in years. Ultimately we discover that meditation is the greatest study of all, for it takes us beyond the domain of intellect and mind itself.",

        "COMMENT": "We see the graceful figure of a young man, studying a pentacle he holds up in his hands. He is turned toward his left, the side of the brain which we use to study information. He is surrounded by colors of yellow, signifying the solar plexus and the intellect. The solar plexus is located in the center of our physical body, and as such, is that point which identifies us with our physical form in this life. He is dressed in green, signifying health, well-being. Channeling that awareness toward education and study is a positive direction, and the red trim on his clothing indicates that he has focused his energy with care to accomplish his goals."

The Knight of Pentacles indicates a change in the patterns of learning, studying, and/or working. Some change may be coming in the energy we apply to our school or our studies, or perhaps we have developed an invigorating new approach to our current job.

She uses these aspects of her life to build stability and to provide a nurturing environment for others. The earth is her source of provisions. When found in a reading, the 'earth mother' indicates a solid sense of home and earthly abundance. A positive addition to any reading, this card is always associated with feeling safe and being taken care of. If it turns up as your significator, (see Tarot Reading section on page 235) you are indeed a generous, receptive individual and know how to use the gifts of earth for others. If it turns up in an otherwise negative reading, this card’s positive power can offer strength and energy to make it through the worst of times.",

Hard work plus masculine energy can provide a protective environment and safety in the sea of change. Hence, the King of Pentacles also implies great stability. Our practical accomplishments can provide comfortable safety, rich with the gifts from the earth. On the negative side, we need to avoid such intense focus on learning and career that we are robbed of the ability to nurture others and to remember to focus on serving all others and God.",

The presence of this card almost always signifies removal of an old karmic scar, either positive or negative. If there is no perceivable external change, then an internal veil is being peeled away, so we can we see our circumstances from a clearer perspective, a higher angle of vision. Always remember that the most important changes happen within us. No matter which of our karmic veils and scars are cut, or how painfully, our effort to remain aware that this too is a great gift that will help us tremendously on our spiritual journey.

        "CARD": "two",
        "SUIT": "Swords",
        "THOUGHTS": "The two swords crossed symbolize the extremes of duality, of good and evil, divided. This card also means that the Swords of raw power become trapped in the opposites of duality. Similarly, the heights and depths of emotions can become so entangled that we become overwhelmed, lose clarity, and cannot untangle the knots of karmic, worldly circumstances. Bound by a limited perspective, we move through our circumstances as if blindfolded. We may even be hiding behind our blindfold, hunkering down within our self-imposed constrictions. If we try to force balance in this limited position, it is gained through suppression and denial—not by clear thinking. Such balance is false, shaky, and unstable—subject to change and unpleasant reversals. Though we may feel we are maintaining balance by our rigid suppression, we discover all too quickly that such balance is coupled with fear and will ultimately topple like a palace built of cards. Further, self-analysis under these circumstances is misleading and draws us into inappropriate conclusions and incorrect assumptions. The two swords may represent choices—both of which have difficulties and opportunities. Our fear of making the wrong choice leads to paralysis, and often we are unable to identify how to emerge from these constrictions. Our life is filled with such duality, and we feel we must act but don’t know how. We feel unable to move forward, stuck between a rock and a hard place. Under these circumstances a seeker after Truth searches for the Inner Path and the Inner Guide. The first step in this process is to transform those hard choices into trust in God. Submission and trust will relax the energy of the Swords, and allow the blocked energy of a solution to begin to flow, and we become enabled to lay down the crossed swords and finally remove our blindfold. When all else fails, the following jewel of wisdom applies: If there is still no clear way ahead, mindful inaction may actually serve as the best course, at least temporarily. This decision, accompanied with trust in God’s greater wisdom, ultimately helps to unbind the paralysis. It will actually serve as a comfort to 'let go'—even to non-action—not suppression.

It appears as if she is trying not to move so as to maintain her balance as she sits precariously on an unseen rock or wood piling on the beach. The swords appear to be as restrictive and binding as a straightjacket. The light of the new moon, symbolizing the light of inner wisdom, is too small to penetrate her blindfold. Unlike the dancer in the Two of Pentacles, this woman cannot look upon the ocean of understanding behind her even if she were to turn.

A broken heart, grief of loss or death of a loved one, a betrayal, a broken trust—all are meanings attributed to this card. Generally, the stability and strength implied by the pyramid of three becomes distorted when expressed in the Sword suit, and can result in a destructive triangular relationship of some kind. The energy of this card can suggest personal rejection caused by some third element, be it person or power or obsession or circumstance of any kind. The struggle we confront in the spiritual journey is only satisfied by merging in God. Our human ego-self is the destructive third element in the triangle. However, for the spiritual traveler, the painful energy of separation can be interpreted in this card as longing for God. Even our intellectual awareness of this possibility can affect this transformation. In its negative aspect this card indicates a blinding self-pity, but even that pain can be transformed into longing and drive us closer to God.

The triple swords of the air element suspended here indicate a need for rest, healing, inner focus and meditation. With the fourth sword lying at rest beneath him, symbolizing a safe and supportive foundation, this is a time for him to retreat from worldly actions and decisions—and rebalance. Even though the spiritual warrior is still dressed in his chain metal tunic, he realizes that meditation and repose is not a denial of responsibility. Rather, he recognizes that he needs renewal to rebuild his strength, so he can continue to serve others selflessly with love—whether through outward connections or daily meditation.

It therefore represents a very dangerous projection we may adopt toward others, or others may adopt toward us. It is blind, it is based upon fear, it is not understood by us and can easily get out of control. This card usually indicates extreme frustration, to the point where we no longer can process our reality. Rage can begin by a feeling of powerlessness and fear over a situation—a situation we may have falsely judged. We feel no longer in control, and we become immersed in the need to lash out. Unfortunately, this mental scar, this karmic knot, can have disastrous consequences. This card involves many aspects of the effects of anger and rage, to the extent of warfare and battle. Rarely, unlike the Five of Ankhs, does this anger become internally directed. Judgments and self-righteousness prevail, and acting these emotions out is the primary meaning of this card. On a positive note, the Five of Swords may sometimes indicate our soul’s frustration with the pressures and confinement of life, and its desire to leave the body to escape. The cards surrounding it will determine whether or not this is its meaning. The extremes of this meaning are realized more often in the Five of Ankhs, as that card represents the recognition of the internal solitude of rage, a clearer recognition of the confinement of the soul in the body, thereby becoming more inwardly directed, rather than projected outward onto others and situations. \n",

One man lays slain upon the ground, his sword by his side, with two warriors enraged behind him, raising their swords and fists in vengeance. Although the participants seem to be frozen in an impasse, the sky reflects a roiling tornado of rage, moving and roaring throughout the scene, permeating their still forms. When looking at this picture, one has the feeling that the scene is held still but for an instant before erupting into further violence."

But in the Six of Swords we are looking at a victory over circumstances or a victory in the battle against the self. As in the picture, the points of the swords of karma are pointing to the sea underneath the boat, no longer directed toward us. When we energetically apply our attention to loving God and being a servant of Love, we are detaching from the karmic web and swords of our life. This action itself helps us rise above them, and cuts through the turmoil of despair and confusion. This card means that our karmas are not permanent, and that we are moving or can move through them to a transcendent shore.",

They stand vertically, but with handles upright at the front of the boat. His expression is earnest, sincere, and peaceful as he focuses on the difficult task of moving his boat across the waters to the far shore."

        "THOUGHTS": "We may identify with the victim or the thief in this card. While getting drunk in his tent, the victim is unable to perceive that he is being deceived. Similarly, distractions in life may blind us to deception, either from our self or others. Our ego drives us to be self-absorbed which steals our sight, our clarity, our love for God. As we grow on the path of meditation, we know more and more that we want to work for God and for Love, yet subtle demands of the ego may still remain hidden from our view. Thus, the Seven of Swords represents the 'hidden agenda' of ego rather than God-driven goals. Remember the mystic’s plea, 'Thy will, not mine, oh Lord.' The ego wants satisfaction, but a satisfied ego keeps us away from God. When we steal power in the darkness of night, we must live with that false power during the brightness of day. The mind believes that it can do things in secret, like deceiving others, and no one will know. But God knows. There are no secrets. The mind must live with the results of its own desires, obsessions, and longings. Deceiving others for personal gain creates a darkness within our heart. So whether we are a victim of deception by another, or perpetrator of deception ourselves, this card is one of warning. It tells us to take a closer look, through meditation—or through discussion with one whom we trust —at our thought patterns and priorities.",

        "SUIT": "Swords",
        "THOUGHTS": "This card demonstrates a mind surrounded by rejection, fear, confusion, pride, and resentment—whether warranted by circumstances, imagined, or self-imposed. We have been hurt, badly hurt, and we cannot seem to recover. We are imprisoned within a wall comprised of painful and powerful swords which we cannot see. We feel too unworthy to ask for solace and help from those who love us, nor do we find comfort in anything that ever had positive meaning to us, such as meditation and the Path. When we dwell in the pain of secluded self-involvement, we are victimizing ourselves. Whether we are conscious of it or not, we have accepted this prison-cell of swords as our reality, and subsequently we find ourselves bound, blinded, and even unable to move. In the extreme, this card in a reading can indicate paranoia of an advanced degree, feeling that we can trust no one; everyone has, or will, fail us. Furthermore, when we are excessively judgmental or critical of others, we ultimately push them away and find ourselves alone, even if we really do not wish to be alone. The results can be hurtful, confusing, catastrophic, and imprisoning to the soul. Exile is too high a price to pay for maintaining such a negative attitude. On the other hand, when others are imprisoned during their own rough times, their own sense of excommunication can be inflicted upon us. In such circumstances, even our own conscious being can become lost in self-pity. Hence, we need to guard against taking the traumatic circumstances of others personally. When positively aspected, the Eight of Swords most often indicates that we are being pushed away from a situation for a reason. We may experience intense pain in the process, but it may be a situation or relationship from which we need to be spared. For the spiritual traveler, this interpretation of the card is frequently true. If we feel confused by the Spiritual Path or rejected by any aspect of the Path, this card may indicate that we need to speak to someone to understand our feelings. There are always factors that we are not aware of in any situation, factors which may reverse our feelings of victimization and pain if we understood them more clearly.",

She is dressed in a heavily embroidered black robe which falls just below her ankles; her long thick raven hair spills from the blindfold in flowing waves, nearly reaching her waist. The robe is regal and beautiful, suggesting she is one of royal birth or great wealth, as does the castle high on the rocky cliffs above and behind her. A clear path stretches behind her, and winds its way up on the edge of the cliff tops to the remote and beautiful golden castle. She stands within a picket wall of eight swords, plunging randomly into the rocky sand around her. Her expression is pouting and sad. She seems to be internally experiencing deep negative feelings. The sky is brilliant blue and clear of clouds, yet she cannot see."

The anguish and despair of the experience signified by this card is almost too much to bear. This sense of hopelessness in this card differs from that in the Eight of Swords, because now we are becoming aware that the real source of our pain is within us, and is separation from God. At any stage in our growth, it is important for us to know that the pain of separation can become this overwhelming. This pain is truly a gift on the Path, and our prayer should be to receive this gift with as much grace and acceptance as possible. For, in truth, the writings of mystics have reflected the extremes of their intense pain of longing and awareness of separation. Our self will not give up to pain easily. Circumstances will build up to show us that we must sacrifice the self-awareness we are so familiar with in order to find God. Our need for personal comfort sometimes turns into panic, and then we despair that we cannot handle the pain. Though we know we’re on the right track > and growing as fast as we can, the self cries out for comfort. Daryai Lal Kapur used to say to me, 'Every tear shed in longing for God, in yearning for our True Home, creates a necklace of pearls which God wears.' Whether or not we attribute this pain to separation from God, it will help us to see that all our pain originates from this state of separateness. The Nine of Swords is almost intolerable anguish for any of us to bear, but the purpose is to break a negative cycle. Again, we must not forget that this process is a gift from God, and cuts away a veil of separation from our Goal. The good news is that God has made us worthy for such extreme surgery of our soul.",

The Ten of Swords pierces the Third Eye with an awareness that God is within us—and everywhere.

We may be deceived because we are misinterpreting another’s intentions—a frequent occurrence when we feel wronged by others. Alternatively, someone around us may be wielding more power than wisdom, which may be affecting us and our circumstances in a negative way. In short, we may be self-deceived, or we may actually be the object of another’s deception.

In its negative aspect, this card can indicate a lack of kindness. If a person in our life is unkind to us, that person may need to be understood and loved for their other qualities. One measure which almost unfailingly works is that we recognize most easily in others the qualities we possess within our own being.

        "SUIT": "cups",
        "THOUGHTS": "The Cup of love shared between two people is enjoyable. But when two individuals focus intensely on each other there is a tendency to pull down into the two 'selves.' The attachment of misdirected love has a tendency to pull us out of our center and down into the swirl of expectations and disappointments, even to that of obsessive, jealous, and compulsive behavior towards the other. Though we may feel we are 'in love,' this perspective is a distortion of focus, even when unintentional. Two-of-Cups love is part of life and growing, but there is a danger of exclusiveness, of focusing too obsessively on a one-on-one relationship. Though we want to embrace others—in fact, the whole universe—into the circle of our love, we are not able to uphold that feeling through time, if at all. The focus of our personal feelings for each other ultimately proves to be an unsatisfying experience. What actually happens is our 'shakti' energy (latent energy stored at the base of the spine) is awakened when triggered by the blush of new love, and affects our heart center and even higher centers. However, when our soul discovers that the person to whom we have attributed this awakening of love is not God, then that energy falls back to its normal position in the spine. We may then recognize the fallacy of one-on-one relationships, and feel 'caught in a loop.' We feel helplessly bound and blinded by the belief that our life cannot go on until we have acquired that special someone, even if we understand the futility and pointlessness of that belief. In the most positive aspect of this card, we can love each other as totally as we know how, but with God as the primary living force in our love. It is rare and difficult, but when we are both simultaneously completely devoted to loving God first, our love for each other will blossom and mature beyond our wildest dreams. In fact, the only way love between two people can last in a one-on-one relationship is when God is the primary focus. Then, as we embrace the universe in that love, it is nourished and is sustained. As we grow as partners in the Love of God, we become more and more like the The Lovers in the Major Arcana. We work together and support each other’s efforts to focus the energy of love continuously towards God. \n",

Eventually we will turn and see the full cups behind us. A spiritual seeker can become caught up in the disappointments of life as easily as anyone else. This is often a way for God to turn our attention inside. When we focus our attention on our inner spiritual journey, our awareness of what is really important—God-realization—significantly changes.

Similarly, our desires and goals in life surround us in a dizzying array. The world is a like a three-ring circus, with attractions and fascinations that pull us from object to object, person to person, situation to situation. Even our fears can be intriguing and distracting. These personal attractions are the most insidious obstacles on our inner journey. They provide us with limitless excuses to stay stuck in our own small world. Whether these desires are minor or major, they inhibit the forward motion on our journey to God-realization. The white mystery in the cup represents the choice of 'jumping off the cliff' to explore the unknown, the unseen—our spiritual journey into expanding consciousness and awareness. This card is not necessarily judgmental. After all, we all have karmas that we need to go through. If we already are a spiritual traveler, we may find that our present situation may be absorbing our attention and distracting us.

In our daily lives we are constantly beset with the paradox of duality. It can be very confusing and upsetting, causing conflict in us that can turn into obstacles on the Path.

In this card, we reach for and feel the presence of Spirit lifting our awareness into a receptive state where our own healing can begin, whether physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual. Here, there is both submission to God’s Will and acceptance of our pain of separation which enables a deeper healing to occur. The moment we reach for guidance, we grasp how our suffering serves to open our awareness of God’s healing Presence and Love. Healing is an active state in which the soul is engaged, and one where our soul is being made worthy, cleansed, and prepared to return to its origin. The Three of Ankhs indicates that an active restorative healing is or can take place as we consciously reach for the healing hand of God. We have spun our own web of destiny throughout the ages, where belief in the mind and in our own individuality has ruled; where the ego has reigned in its black and white domain with all the grays in between. We have woven our karmic threads so thickly that we cannot see a way out. Indeed, we do not even remember the existence of consciousness beyond our own ego-mind. We are thus caught in the web we have spun and remain in the darkness of our own self-made prison. In short, our soul not only needs restorative healing, but first needs to recognize its karmic entrapment in mind. Through the Grace of God, a longing and a restlessness builds in us to be healed of our blindness. We become aware of our soul’s need to rise beyond the karmic webs and veils we have spun. Even though, when this card appears in a reading, it can refer to any kind of physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual healing, our focus must remain on the healing of our soul. Following the instructions of our spiritual teacher and focusing our efforts to serve God through meditation—coupled with our longing for God and our acceptance of God’s will in our life—all are vital parts of the healing process. \nWhen we take other healing routes, such as spiritualist hands-on healing, we are not seeing the entire picture of our needs nor those of another.

Simple emotional anger comes and goes like the wind. Raw anger and deep rage is totally consuming, and blinds us to Love and Truth, especially when we believe we are righteous, and acting on behalf of the Will of God, or on the behalf of the beliefs of a cause. Throughout history we see evidence of this particular kind of horror, from the Holy Wars . . . to the burning of witches in Salem . . . to the Holocaust . . . to the Ku Klux Klan. When consumed by this energy, we cannot even see that there are those who love us, all that is good in our lives becomes shadowed, darkened, even blackened, by the power of our fanaticism. Also, when failed expectations are accompanied by self-righteousness, anger is the natural outcome. If this causes us to become angry with God, we create within ourselves a sense of separation and isolation. Our self-righteous expectations result in a kind of estrangement or 'spiritual' suicide as our anger drives us away from God. Fixed rigid expectations frequently lead to hard disappointments. So it is up to us to soften our expectations. When we demand from God, we do not learn from God. Anger against God is the most insidious form of self-destruction. However, we can transmute the power of fanaticism into the power of longing for God because it is the other side of the same coin. We can also use this understanding to forgive those who have taken a self-righteous, destructive path. We can put every ounce of our effort into trusting in God’s Will, and into begging God for His Mercy, to pull us beyond the darker constraints and shackles of our blind state of mind. Sometimes, when we feel this self-righteousness or angered disillusionment, the simplest prayer becomes, 'God, help me through this.'

Sometimes, for a person who feels no obvious addiction, the card may be a warning that some behavior pattern which has not yet been recognized may be obsessive or addictive. For example, loving another may turn into possessive obsession which takes up every bit of attention and creates only misery. In a sense we are all 'addicted to the self', and rising above the self is the great struggle of the Path. Spiritual travelers have a strong, built-in capacity to be obsessive. This is a taste of the same fuel of 100 percent longing and focus which propels the aspiring mystic on his or her journey. When that obsessiveness is directed to things or persons of the world, it is simply misplaced. From a spiritual perspective, this signifies our addiction and immersion in separation or 'I-ness.' Having our consciousness imprisoned in this state of being causes unbearable pain and renders us truly helpless. \nThis drives us to long and desperately search for a lasting cure which can only be to find and realize God. We can only pray for the Grace of God to transmute these feelings into longing for God-realization, into yearning for our Beloved. Then, rather than causing only misery which we wish desperately to be rid of, such longing, when directed to God or our spiritual teacher, becomes so sweet that we don’t ever want to let it go.",

        "COMMENT": "The Seven of Ankhs shows a young woman, dressed in seductive red clothing, reclining on a couch and reaching for a drink. In the background are prison bars which she does not see, and two figures dressed in black, insidiously leering and preying upon the energy of her addiction. These are etheric entities, and she cannot see them. She is caught in the grip of an addiction or obsession—chained, unable to let go, engulfed in self-deception, unable to search for any door other than one which fulfills the object of her addiction or obsession."

When a seeker loves God more than the world, sometimes the world reacts with fear. As Christ said in the Gospel of St. John, 'If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.' Persecution provides an opportunity for ever greater love and compassion. Look at what they did to Christ, one of the greatest, gentlest Masters of our age. He was abandoned by all his disciples with the exception of John and the three Mary’s while he was tortured on a cross. In response, all he said about those who persecuted him was, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' In a reading, this card reminds us that suffering is sometimes the result of living in a world that is set up to reward ego, rather than love.",

Structures in their negative aspect can be confining, inducing us to seek strength in the structure, and we may forget the substance or the goal. For example, the home and family provide a nurturing, protective environment, but some can experience these as one of confinement.

        "CARD": "20",
        "SUIT": "judgement",
        "THOUGHTS": "The call may come in many forms. For a seeker, there are many glimpses of the Presence of the Shabd within, calling us to come home. For a spiritual traveler, the call comes through direct personal experience of the Presence of God. For both seekers and spiritual travelers, this card reminds us to cherish, honor and follow those glimpses of transcendent Truth revealed within our experience. Evelyn Underhill writes about these glimpses of the Shabd’s call in her book Practical Mysticism: Those were onsets of involuntary contemplation; sudden partings of the conceptual veil . . . Did you not then, like the African saint, 'thrill with love and dread,' though you were not provided with a label for that which you adored? . . . a world which you recognized as more valid . . . than that in which you usually dwell; a world which had a wholeness, a meaning, which exceeded the sum of its parts . . . It simplified and unified existence: it stripped off the little accidents and ornaments which perpetually deflect our vagrant attention, and gathered up the whole being of you into one state, which felt and knew a Reality that your intelligence could not comprehend. Such an emotion is the driving power of spirit, an august and ultimate thing: and this your innermost inhabitant felt it to be, whilst your eyes were open to the light.",
        "KEY": "KEY: Being called by God to new life",
        "COMMENT": "Our living physical bodies are really the coffins of the soul. The soul is trapped in the coffin of self-imprisonment by the ego. While the Death card indicates that the ego must die in order to allow the soul to be born, Judgment represents the Shabd calling to the soul, pulling the soul, urging the soul to struggle against the bars of its prison."

        "CARD": "21",
        "SUIT": "the rose",
        "THOUGHTS": "The underlying cause of all loneliness and frustration is our innermost desire to merge with God. The higher we evolve in consciousness, the greater and purer does this longing and yearning become. This card depicts that total, one-pointed, passion for God, which is the highest and deepest essence of the Mystical Path.",
        "KEY": "KEY: The passion of longing and yearning for God",
        "COMMENT": "While our love and longing for God is usually colored with a variety of other desires and distractions, God’s passionate love—and longing—for us is boundless and ever-present."

        "CARD": "22",
        "SUIT": "the universe",
        "THOUGHTS": "As the final card in the Major Arcana, its significance deeply influences other cards in a reading, because it lifts our mind, body and soul to a focus on God-realization. This card can also signify the very highest state of mystical union with the Supreme Ocean of God.",
        "KEY": "KEY: Growing inner awareness of God; mystical union with God",
        "COMMENT": "This card, The Universe (referred to as 'The World' in traditional Tarot decks) refers to the Inner World, not this outer world of mundane circumstance. It is a very positive card for the spiritual traveler, for it means that the door of transcendent love is opening further, from whatever stage we may be in. This card places the image of the Inner Master in the center, reaching through the veil of separation and welcoming the spiritual traveler into the Inner Realms of higher awareness and God Consciousness. The essence of the image depicts how thin the veil is that separates us from higher levels of consciousness, and that our teacher is there to help us navigate those realms when we are taken within."
